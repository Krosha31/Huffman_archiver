Add element at the end
Adds a new element at the end of the vector, after its current last element. The content of val is copied (or moved) to the new element.

This effectively increases the container size by one, which causes an automatic reallocation of the allocated storage space if -and only if- the new vector size surpasses the current vector capacity.
